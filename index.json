In particular, given scenes with some combinations of objects, if an agent has learned to interpret them as objects and their interactions, it should be able to generalize to scenes with novel combinations of objects. We (1) formalize the compositional generalization problem with an algebraic approach and (2) study how an agent can achieve that. We introduce (1) a synthetic and fully controllable environment and (2) a principled empirical approach to systematically measure the compositional generalization ability. Motivated by the formulation, we emprically compare several methods using our environments and design a straightforward approach, Homomorphic Object-oriented World Model (HOWM), to study compositional generalization in dynamics prediction.\nMore details: To appear, will be submitted to ICLR 2022.\n","date":1629676800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629676800,"objectID":"243c24426e603b5bc60fa7c467682a99","permalink":"https://example.com/project/compositional_generaliaztion/","publishdate":"2021-08-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/compositional_generaliaztion/","section":"project","summary":"compositional generalization, object-oriented world model","tags":["Compositional Generalization"],"title":"Compositional Generalization in Object-Oriented Environments","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This project deals with decision making problems in autonomous driving by applying deep reinforcement learning and behavioral cloning algorithm in a simulated car racing environment. To be specific, we will implement deep reinforcement learning algorithms (Proximal Policy Optimization) and behavioral cloning algorithm (DAGGER) and use them to teach an agent car to play the CarRacing game. As a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, Proximal Policy Optimization directly optimizes the cumulative reward without using a value function, and it is able to be trained directly with nonlinear function approximations such as neural networks. Dataset Aggregation is an efficient way to reproduce the expert demonstrated behavior. Expert data will first be obtained by some well-trained expert. Then, the state and actions made by the expert will be recorded at the same time. Our goal for behavioral cloning is to teach an agent to play the game using expert demonstrated data.\nAs shown in the figure below, For traditional behavior cloning, we first collect expert demonstration data, and use it to learn a policy mapping from states to actions. However, there are some problems with this method. Expert only samples limited obersavations or, states, so the policy will make big mistakes when the agent goes to a state that has not been encountered before.   One solution for this problem is Dataset aggregration, or dagger. The idea of dagger is that we use our learned policy to interact with the enviornment, and record the states and the action under expert policy. Then we add the new data to the dataset, and use the new dataset to train our new policy. It is just like iterative version of behavior cloning.\nMore details: Report , Slides , Video .\n","date":1629676800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629676800,"objectID":"6c0d869d9f42fbffbe8fe01411ceeca9","permalink":"https://example.com/project/rl_car_racing/","publishdate":"2021-08-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/rl_car_racing/","section":"project","summary":"Deep reinforcement learning, imitation learning","tags":["RL"],"title":"Teaching an Artificial Agent to Play CarRacing Game","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The conventional human-performed surgery of bone tumor resection has the drawbacks of imprecise, high labor intense on surgeons, longer recovery time. In this project, a surgical robot system for bone tumor resection is developed. First, the preoperative image of experimental bone is obtained by CT scanning. Then the surgeon is able to plan a surgery path by means of choosing key points on the 3D bone model. Second, the relationship between image space and surgical space is established. Finally the surgery path made by the surgeon in image space is mapped to surgical space and robot can receive the commands to operate the surgery. Meanwhile, the position of the surgical tool is displayed in image space in real time. Acetabular bone and thigh bone trials were performed at hospital and the outcome shows the feasibility of using robot to resect bone tumor.\nAs shown in the figure below, the brief scheme of this project is to use the CT data of the bone to guide the robot to do the bone resection surgery. We first get the CT data of the bone and reconstruct it to a 3D model. Then, we load the 3D reconstructed image of the bone into 3D slicer, an open source software for research in image guided therapy, in which the surgeon could make a surgical path by choosing key points. Second we build the relationship between image space and surgical space. This is realized by ICP algorithm with two separated steps. Finally, we map the surgery path planned by the surgeon from image space to surgical space and command the robot to operate the surgery. Meanwhile, the position of the surgery tool is displayed in image space.\n   More details: Report , Slides , Video .\n","date":1629244800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629244800,"objectID":"07bcfff36cf06308559363cbfe167ee4","permalink":"https://example.com/project/surgical_robot/","publishdate":"2021-08-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/surgical_robot/","section":"project","summary":"Surgical Robot for Bone Resection Surgery","tags":["Robotics"],"title":"Image-Guided Surgical Robot","type":"project"},{"authors":["Lingzhi Kong","Âê≥"],"categories":["Demo"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
